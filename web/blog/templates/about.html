  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>Research Interest</h2>
    <p>My research interest is mainly in deep learning and photolithography process system integration.
      As a photolithography engineer, I have been working with various types of lithography tools and process systems.
      This allows me to have a better understanding of the lithography process and the challenges faced by the engineers.
      By proposing novel systems that helps to improve the current process, I was able to accumulate approximately $10M annual cost
      savings through various system projects. Some of the projects involves the use of deep learning to detect defects from
      the wafer images. These projects are aimed to be able to detect defects in real time fashion (~1s) and outperform the
      vendor's defect detection system.

    <h2>Personal Interest</h2>
    <p>I enjoy helping others in transforming and improving their current work through digitization and digitalization.
      This is the main pushing factor for pursuing my MSc in Industrial 4.0 with National University of Singapore.
      During my time in NUS, I have worked with Micron Technology on a sponsored capstone project: Auto Correlation
      Study and Forecasting in Yield Analysis. I have developed an end to end machine learning framework to correlate
      inline data with yield data. It helps engineers to narrow down and/or identify the root cause of yield loss with
      a high precision in an accessible manner.
